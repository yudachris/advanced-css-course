# Natours

Natours is a project created by <a href="https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann">Jonas Schmedtmann</a> in his advanced css course on Udemy.<br>
In this course, I will learn (and probably have learned by the time you read this) about things related to advanced techniques used for making animation, visual effects, popups, interactive forms, in pure CSS.<br>
While yes, I basically just code the same thing that he made, I tried to understand every concept and techniques that he uses in this course. Only and IF only I fully understands the concept and the why (use this on this, use that on that), then I code.<br>
Anyway, thank you for visiting!
